# rvm
My attempt at a Rlang Version (and package) Manager (WIP)

This is intended for project developers who want reproducibility and great package syncronization, and it's less directed for package developers.

I'm developing rvm because packrat and renv (and jetpack which uses renv) are dependent on R (and with that cannot manage R versions without trickery), Roo uses python (and does not manage R versions either (at least on windows)), rig does not manage packages, and I'm not familiar with any other tool.

Feel free to raise issues and contribute, this is still very very early in development.
